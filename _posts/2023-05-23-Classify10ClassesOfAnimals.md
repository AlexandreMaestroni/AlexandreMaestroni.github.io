#Topic : Classify 10 types of animals


Today, I tried to adpt the bird code to classify my 10 animals. The first problem that I encounter is that it takes a lot of time to run the code (around 30 minutes).

I am currently having issues with some images because the name of an animal can be also linked to a brand. For example the panther are a hockey team so I have sometimes a photo of a hockey player.
