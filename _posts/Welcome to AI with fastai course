Topic: Welcome to AI with fastai course

In this post I will talk about what I personally learned regarding AI while reading the fastai course.

Today we will cover my global understanding of the AI and the fastai course after a quick look, then the next days we will talk deepper about these subjects.

I understand that with the fast ai course we are able to recognize some animals on photos and I guess it would also be possible for objects. 
That is really interesting because if we are that far in the process of recognition with an AI, it means that an AI would be able to recognize an human from another one soon. Then, it would be easy to detect all the behaviour of this human and predict his future.
Therefore, I think the AI is really growing fast, and the combination of recognition AI added to a chatGPT would be crazy.

We already know that AI can beat humans in strategic games. What would be the outcome if an AI was directing a war?

So obviously, AI can be dangerous but for now we will focus on creating that classify 10 species of animals and create a deep learning model that classify real or fake images.
Also I need to remember how to use Python because it has been a while that I did not use it.
