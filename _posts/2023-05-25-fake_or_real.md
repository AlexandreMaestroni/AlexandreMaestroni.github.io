# Topic : Classify fake and real images

There is a contest on Kaggle to see who will succeed in developing a deep learning model to recognize fake or real images. Unfortunately, for the moment, I cannot load the images in my google collab because the file is too big.

I am trying to load it at a zip and make google collab unzip it but at the moment I am stuck.
It's ok I figure out that the zip file was broken.

The next problem that I encountered was that an image wasn't there to be reshaped. Hopefully, it was only ffor one so I just make the code to continue after this.
